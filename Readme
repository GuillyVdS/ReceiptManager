This project aims to quickly analyze an emailed tesco receipt and determine how the bill should be split between two people.

This is achieved by using PDF parser to analyze line items and by assigning these items to either or both persons responsible for paying off the receipt.

Each time the program is ran, it will check the allocations.json file to look for previously identified line items.
